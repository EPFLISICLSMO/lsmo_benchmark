Benchmark tests for LSMO group.
(notice: the repository MUST be cloned in the scratch partition of the cluster)

Usage
0) always pull the latest version 
1) go into the directory of your code (cp2k, qe, vasp, ...)
2) copy one of the scripts, renaming it properly:
index_cluster_codeversion_compiler/module.sh
e.g.: 01_bellatrix_cp2k-2.6_deprecated-intel.sh
3) modify the scripts:
 - change the number of cpusxnode according to the cluster
 - change the slurm input according to the module you want to load 
   (please keep "module purge" before) 
 
4) run the script (in the scratch partition for consistence)
5) run xx_results.sh to grep the run time
6) $ git add *
7) $ git commit -am "comments"
8) $ git push

NOTICE:
- For certain computers (e.g., Piz Daint) different nodes are available with different speed. Therefore different calculations can be done on diffeent nodes. Constrain the choice of the node-type if you want, but this is not mandatory and therefore the parallelization benchmark time can oscillate because of this.
